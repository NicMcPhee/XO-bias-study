  abstract = {We present the results of a community survey regarding
                  genetic programming (GP) benchmark
                  practices. Analysis shows broad consensus that
                  improvement is needed in problem selection and
                  experimental rigor. While views expressed in the
                  survey dissuade us from proposing a large-scale
                  benchmark suite, we find community support for
                  creating a ``blacklist'' of problems which are in
                  common use but have important flaws, and whose use
                  should therefore be discouraged. We propose a set of
                  possible replacement problems.}
